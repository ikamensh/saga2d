Animated unit: walks to a target, plays attack animation, then idles.

# That's it. 15 lines.
#
# What's handled:
# - Sprite sheet loading and slicing (by naming convention or companion .json)
# - Animation frame timing, looping, completion callbacks
# - Movement with smooth interpolation (tween system)
# - Bottom-center anchoring (default for game sprites)
# - Composing movement + frame animation simultaneously
# - No manual distance/direction math
# - No manual frame timer logic
# - No sprite sheet cutting code
# - Callback chaining just works (play on_complete → next animation)
#
# For a death sequence:
#   self.knight.play(death, on_complete=lambda: self.knight.remove())
#
# For a projectile:
#   arrow = Sprite("sprites/arrow", position=archer.position)
#   arrow.move_to(target.position, speed=500, on_arrive=lambda: [
#       arrow.remove(),
#       target.play(hit_reaction),
#   ])
#
# For complex multi-step sequences, use composable Actions instead of callbacks:
#
#   from easygame.actions import Sequence, Parallel, PlayAnim, MoveTo, Delay, Do, Remove
#
#   self.knight.do(Sequence(
#       Parallel(PlayAnim(walk), MoveTo((500, 400), speed=200)),
#       PlayAnim(attack),
#       Delay(0.3),
#       Do(lambda: target.do(Sequence(PlayAnim(hit), PlayAnim(death), Remove()))),
#       Parallel(PlayAnim(walk), MoveTo((100, 400), speed=200)),
#       PlayAnim(idle),
#   ))
