"""Screenshot regression tests for Stage 10 Composable Actions.

Run from the project root::

    pytest tests/screenshot/test_action_screenshots.py -v

Requires pyglet (GPU context) and pre-generated assets
(``python generate_assets.py``).  Excluded from the normal ``pytest tests/``
run by ``collect_ignore`` in ``tests/conftest.py``.

Each test creates a Scene, attaches an Action to a sprite, advances the
game loop a calculated number of ticks, then captures and compares a
screenshot.  Golden images are auto-created on first run.

Tests use the knight and skeleton assets (walk cycles, idle frames) that
are already present in ``assets/images/sprites/``.
