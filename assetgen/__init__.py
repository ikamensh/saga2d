"""
assetgen - Procedural asset generation toolkit for EasyGame.

Provides Pillow-based drawing primitives and 3D wireframe math
used by sprite generators to create placeholder and final art assets.

Submodules:
    primitives  - Filled/outlined polygons, gradients, hatching, ellipses.
    wireframe   - 3D shapes, rotation, projection, edge rendering.
